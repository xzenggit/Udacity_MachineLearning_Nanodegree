The core of an SVM is a quadratic programming problem (QP), separating support vectors from the rest of the training data. The QP solver used by this libsvm-based implementation scales between $O(n_{features} \\times n_{samples}^2)$ and $O(n_{features} \\times n_{samples}^3)$ depending on how efficiently the libsvm cache is used in practice (dataset dependent).

    "** Model 2: Decision Trees **\n",
    "\n",
    "* Time and space complexity: In general, the run time cost to construct a balanced binary tree is $O(n_{samples}n_{features}\\log(n_{samples}))$ and query time $O(\\log(n_{samples}))$. Although the tree construction algorithm attempts to generate balanced trees, they will not always be balanced. Assuming that the subtrees remain approximately balanced, the cost at each node consists of searching through $O(n_{features})$ to find the feature that offers the largest reduction in entropy. This has a cost of $O(n_{features}n_{samples}\\log(n_{samples}))$ at each node, leading to a total cost over the entire trees (by summing the cost at each node) of $O(n_{features}n_{samples}^{2}\\log(n_{samples}))$.\n",
    "* General applications, strengths and weakness: Decision Trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.\n",
    "    * Advantages:\n",
    "        - Simple to understand and to interpret. Trees can be visualised.\n",
    "        - Requires little data preparation. \n",
    "        - The cost of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree.\n",
    "        - Able to handle both numerical and categorical data. Other techniques are usually specialised in analysing datasets that have only one type of variable. \n",
    "        - Able to handle multi-output problems.\n",
    "        - Uses a white box model. If a given situation is observable in a model, the explanation for the condition is easily explained by boolean logic. By contrast, in a black box model (e.g., in an artificial neural network), results may be more difficult to interpret.\n",
    "        - Possible to validate a model using statistical tests. That makes it possible to account for the reliability of the model.\n",
    "        - Performs well even if its assumptions are somewhat violated by the true model from which the data were generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Disadvantages:\n",
    "        - Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalise the data well. This is called overfitting. Mechanisms such as pruning, setting the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node or setting the maximum depth of the tree are necessary to avoid this problem.\n",
    "        - Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated. This problem is mitigated by using decision trees within an ensemble.\n",
    "        - The problem of learning an optimal decision tree is known to be NP-complete under several aspects of optimality and even for simple concepts. Consequently, practical decision-tree learning algorithms are based on heuristic algorithms such as the greedy algorithm where locally optimal decisions are made at each node. Such algorithms cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree. This can be mitigated by training multiple trees in an ensemble learner, where the features and samples are randomly sampled with replacement.\n",
    "        - There are concepts that are hard to learn because decision trees do not express them easily, such as XOR, parity or multiplexer problems.\n",
    "        - Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree.\n",
    "* Why choose this model: Decision Trees is a good classification tool. It is capable of performing multi-class classification on a dataset. Because we have relative large features in our dataset, Decision Trees would be a potential cadidate.\n",

Second, in terms of computational time, SVMs ranks in the middle, which is affordable considering current computational resources. Finally, in terms of model itself, SVMs has the highest accuracy when training size is 200, which implies the model would give us better performance with fine-tuning paramters and full traning set (300). \n",
